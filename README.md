# Modeling Non-linear Relationships Using Regression Analysis

This project explores the use of regression analysis to model non-linear relationships between variables. It covers three scenarios:

## 1. Modeling non-linear relationship using Polynomial Regression
   - **Objective**: Predicting marks based on the number of courses taken and the time spent studying daily.
   - **Steps**:
     - Explored the dataset to understand the relationships.
     - Built a Linear Regression model to predict marks.
     - Calculated model metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
     - Conducted residual analysis to check for model assumptions.
     - Fitted a Polynomial Regression model to capture non-linear relationships.
     - Evaluated the performance of the new model.

## 2. Modeling non-linear relationships using data transformation
   - **Objective**: Predicting the distance covered by a truck after a break is applied.
   - **Steps**:
     - Explored the dataset and visualized the relationship between time and distance.
     - Built a Linear Regression model to predict distance.
     - Assessed model performance using R-squared, MSE, and RMSE.
     - Conducted residual analysis and checked for model assumptions.
     - Transformed the time variable using logarithmic transformation to address non-linearity.
     - Rebuilt the regression model and evaluated its performance.

## Conclusion
Regression analysis is a powerful tool not only for modeling linear relationships but also for capturing non-linear patterns in data. By using techniques such as Polynomial Regression and data transformation, we can enhance the predictive capabilities of our models and make more accurate predictions.
